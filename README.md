# Upset 3D
## 3D Code Suite for GameMaker

Upset 3D is a collection of classes, scripts, sprite, and objects that provide a clean starting point for anyone who wishes to make 3D games in the GameMaker engine. The system is designed to be modular, clean, and flexible to make customizing or expanding it as easy as possible for your project.

Upset 3D doesn't aim to rival other 3D game engines but instead aims to lay the groundwork for small-scale 3D games while leaving the door open for expansion. This suite provides a PBR rendering system with glTF model importing and animation, as well as a basic collision system with spatial partitioning.

## Requirements

* Windows / Linux PC 
* GameMaker Beta 2024.1100 (or later)

## Getting the Code

This repository contains a GameMaker project which contains the Upset3D code as well as the code for suite of tests to test various features of the system. You can clone this repository and import the project or download the project template from the [releases](https://github.com/Binsk/u3d-development/releases) section if you only want the Upset 3D code.

## Platform Support

Upset 3D's target platforms are Windows and Linux. These are the only two platforms, at the moment, that are guaranteed to work fully.

The system does have an experimental 'fall-back' rendering mode for platforms that require GLSL ES and this has been tested on GX (VM) and some consoles (VM) with partial success. Not all rendering features will be available in this mode and performance will be sub-par. I would like to improve this mode down the line but it is currently low-prio.

Are you finding this project useful? Feel free to buy me a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/binsk) if you are so inclined!

If that's not to your taste then I'd still be happy just to see what you've created with this project! Shoot me a link on the [GameMaker forums](https://forum.gamemaker.io/index.php?members/binsk.1097/)!
