/// @about
/// An AnimationTree() is responsible for interpolating and/or stacking a number
/// of AnimationTracks() together to allow smooth track transitions and combined
/// animations. When animating a model an AnimationTree() is necessary, even if
/// the tree only contains a single animation track.
///
/// Note that, for performance reasons, animations should be auto-managed via
/// obj_animation_controller. It is possible to handle them manually, however
/// the controller can optimize out redundant transforms and calling states 
/// directly from this class requires a full re-calculation of all animation
/// tracks that are active.
