# Spatial
## About

Spatial shaders refer to shaders that handle rendering things in the 3D world using 3D
coordinates. Several systems render spatially, such as GBuffer generation and shadow mapping.

## Multiple Shaders

GameMaker doesn't allow dynamic shader compiling nor splitting of fragment and vertex shaders.
This means that we have to have a shader for every combination of model data. This gets messy
when you mix static models with models that have skeletal animation and, amongst these you may
have models with or without normals and so-forth.

For now, the GLTFBuilder can fully substitute in fake data for any missing bits so that
everything can render together; however this can add a LOT of loading time as well as 
wasted processing in the vertex shader. As such, there is currently a mix of duplicate
shaders and filled-in fake data. The material will determine which copy to use.

For simplicity, each copy contains the ENTIRETY of the shader but simply uses #define to
remove pieces at compile time. This allows for optimizing out unnecessary pieces while still
allowing an easy copy+paste when updating shader code.
