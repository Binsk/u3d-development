## Animation
3D models can use various kinds of animation but the primary method 
in U3D is skeletal animation. When exported, bone transforms are 
specified through skins, tracks, and channels.

A bone can be transformed in 3 different ways:
* Positional transform
* Rotational transform
* Scalar transform

Although, rotational transforms account for the majority of skeletal
animation. A `channel` is a series of transforms to apply to a 
`bone id` over the length of  an `animation track`. A channel only
defines **one type** of transform so a single bone may have 3
different animation channels, one for each type of transform.

An `animation track` will contain a series of channels that define
how each bone on the model should be transformed at a certain point
in time while a `skin` effectively defines which bone transforms are
applied to which vertices. 

All of this data can be auto-loaded and generated through the 
`GLTFBuilder` in the form of an `AnimationTree`. An `AnimationTree` is
a U3D-specific structure that can contain all the `animation tracks` 
for a model. This class handles queuing which tracks should be active
as well as how tracks should merge and stack to create more complex
and dynamic animations.

The `AnimationTree` can be managed manually, however it is more
effective to attach the tree to the `obj_animation_controller` to 
allow the controller to handle animation updates and optimize out
unnecessary calculations.
