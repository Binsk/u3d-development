# Materials
## About
Materials are a simple structure that help define how the initial
gbuffer pass for a model should be handled. Materials are **not**
responsible for lighting details and the like, but **are** responsible
for managing PBR textures, skeletal animation, and special rendering
cases like billboards or sky-boxes.

Every model you render requires a material.
