# Rendering

## About
The rendering section contains classes for visual elements and 
visual element handlers. This covers both 2D and 3D visual elements.

Many visual elements, such as primitives, can be created once and
used in multiple places and, in fact, **should** be re-used as much
as possible to help speed up the rendering system.

In order to appear on screen, rendering elements must be attached
to a Body and that Body must be added to the rendering controller.

## Rotations
Rotations for almost all visual elements are handled and updated 
through quaternions. While quaternions are fantastic mathematically, 
they can be hard to visualize. When specifying a direction you may
find the functions `vec_to_quat` or `veca_to_quat` useful if you wish
to specify a point direction or rotation around an axis and convert
that into a quaternion.
