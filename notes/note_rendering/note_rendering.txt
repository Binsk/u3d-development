# Rendering

## About
The rendering section contains classes for visual elements and 
visual element handlers. This covers both 2D and 3D visual elements.

Many visual elements, such as primitives, can be created once and
used in multiple places and, in fact, **should** be re-used as much
as possible to help speed up the rendering system.
