# FIXME
-	Textures not on 'own texture page' not rendering right
-	Cube-mapping seams, especially noticeable w/ the mips
-	Shadows are causing halos around objects (?)
-	Loading/unloading floor mesh while rendering elsewhere causes a crash

# TODO
-	[widows] address multple 'attribute' inputs for shaders
-	Add proper PBR simulation in ambient lighting (somewhat done)
-	Greatly speed up the GLTFLoader!
-	System currently renders camera mirrored: to fix some issues;
	this is bad if we want in-game camera rendering so find a way to fix the
	projection matrix.
-	Camera pipeline toggles (e.g., skip shadows, skip emission, lighting pass, 
	etc) so that in-game cameras can have modified renders apart from the actual
	resources being rendered.
-	Add bloom PPFX via light threshold + gaussian blur
-	Lots of file load stuff is async, so consider switching the GLTFBuilder to
	that.
-	Change all the lighting function calls to simply take the camera_id and manually
	pull the GBUFFER
-	Change camera system to instead be an 'eye' where a camera node handles moving
	the eye. This will improve workflow for stereoscopic rendering and the like
