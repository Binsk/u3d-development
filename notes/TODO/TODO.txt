# FIXME
1. [windows] reflections rotate incorrectly
2. Textures not on 'own texture page' not rendering right

# TODO
1. [widows] address multple 'attribute' inputs for shaders
2. Add 'render layers' to Body() for lighting & camera reasons
3. Add proper PBR simulation in ambient lighting (somewhat done)
6. Environment reflections account for roughness (not a simple matter)
7. Add tangent auto-generation upon load
8. Greatly speed up the GLTFLoader!
-	System currently renders camera mirrored w/ OpenGL to fix some issues;
	this is bad if we want in-game camera rendering so find a way to fix the
	projection matrix.
