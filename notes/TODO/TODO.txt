# FIXME
1. [windows] ssao is pure white
2. Textures not on 'own texture page' not rendering right
3. SSAO seems REALLY weak?

# TODO
1. [widows] address multple 'attribute' inputs for shaders
2. Add 'render layers' to Body() for lighting & camera reasons
3. Add proper PBR simulation in ambient lighting (somewhat done)
4. Add proper normal-mapping; requires both adding in GLTFBuilder and
   the gbuffer shader
5. Add emissive texture / component support; in gbuffer could use normal.w
   pbr.x and pbr.w (then we ditch the specular)
6. Environment reflections account for roughness
7. Add tangent auto-generation upon load
8. See if we can move the separate 'view vector' pass into the gbuffer and
   store the buffer across texture channels
