# FIXME
-	[windows] shadow map not sampling (or) rendering correctly
-	Textures not on 'own texture page' not rendering right
-	Cube-mapping seams, especially noticeable w/ the mips

# TODO
-	[widows] address multple 'attribute' inputs for shaders
-	Add proper PBR simulation in ambient lighting (somewhat done)
-	Greatly speed up the GLTFLoader!
-	System currently renders camera mirrored w/ OpenGL to fix some issues;
	this is bad if we want in-game camera rendering so find a way to fix the
	projection matrix.
-	Camera pipeline toggles (e.g., skip shadows, skip emission, lighting pass, 
	etc) so that in-game cameras can have modified renders.
