# FIXME
1. [windows] ssao is pure white
2. Textures not on 'own texture page' not rendering right
3. Convert remaining 'on-the-fly' uniform look-ups for ambient and directional lights
4. Metallic reflections not accounting for roughness?

# TODO
1. [widows] address multple 'attribute' inputs for shaders
2. Add 'render layers' to Body() for lighting & camera reasons
3. Add proper PBR simulation in ambient lighting
4. Add proper normal-mapping; requires both adding in GLTFBuilder and
   the gbuffer shader
5. Add emissive texture / component support; in gbuffer could use normal.w
   pbr.x and pbr.w (then we ditch the specular)
