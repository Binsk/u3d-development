# FIXME
-	Textures not on 'own texture page' not rendering right
-	Cube-mapping seams, especially noticeable w/ the mips
-	Shadow multi-samples are causing halos around objects (?)

# TODO
-	[widows] address multple 'attribute' inputs for shaders
-	Add proper PBR simulation in ambient lighting (somewhat done)
-	Greatly speed up the GLTFLoader (may in-part be due to the RAM leak bug)
-	System currently renders camera mirrored: to fix some issues;
	this is bad if we want in-game camera rendering so find a way to fix the
	projection matrix.
-	Camera pipeline toggles (e.g., skip shadows, skip emission, lighting pass, 
	etc) so that in-game cameras can have modified renders apart from the actual
	resources being rendered. Allows, e.g., dynamic cube-mapping that can ignore
	certain things.
-	Add bloom PPFX via light threshold + gaussian blur
-	Lots of file load stuff is async, so consider switching the GLTFBuilder to
	that.
-	Add model/mesh/primitve "optimizing" that attempts to combine primitives
	and meshes under a model into a new single primitive for optimized rendering.
-	Add some kind of PrimitiveBuilder where you can define a single primitev along
	with a number of copies and matrices and it generates a 'multi-primitive' version
	to render lots of copies as one.
