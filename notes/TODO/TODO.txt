# FIXME
-	[windows] reflections rotate incorrectly
-	[windows] shadow map not sampling (or) rendering correctly
-	Textures not on 'own texture page' not rendering right

# TODO
-	[widows] address multple 'attribute' inputs for shaders
-	Add 'render layers' to Body() for lighting & camera reasons
-	Add proper PBR simulation in ambient lighting (somewhat done)
-	Environment reflections account for roughness (not a simple matter)
-	Greatly speed up the GLTFLoader!
-	System currently renders camera mirrored w/ OpenGL to fix some issues;
	this is bad if we want in-game camera rendering so find a way to fix the
	projection matrix.
-	Optimize fetching inverse / regular matrices from the camera; lots of areas
	use them so they could be cached.
