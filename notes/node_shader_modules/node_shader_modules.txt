# Shader Modules
## About
Shader modules are a bit of a hack to help with managing the
necessary code duplication in GameMaker shaders. In the project's
root directory is a 'process_shader_modules' script that will
read any notes starting with `mod_` and insert them into shaders
that reference them via an `//#include`. 

The processing script is designed in bash script for Linux and is
not really intended for use by the average user but instead by the
developers of the U3D system.
