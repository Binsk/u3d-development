# Space Partitioning
## About
Space partitioning in 3D game development is a method to divide 3D space 
into smaller, manageable sections. This can aid in efficient rendering and 
collision detection, among other things, by quickly ruling out areas that
are not applicable to the current task.

Space partitioning can be attached to the collision system to help speed-up
collision scans as well as the renderer for instance culling.
