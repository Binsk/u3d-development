# Space Partitioning
## About
Space partitioning in 3D game development is a method to divide 3D space 
into smaller, manageable sections. This can aid in efficient rendering and 
collision detection, among other things, by quickly ruling out areas that
are not applicable to the current task.

The collision system requires some kind of space partitioning to function.
By default it simply uses an 'unsorted' partitioning system but can easily
be switched to any other type.
