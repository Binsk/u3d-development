# About

The demo scene is a setup to test loading models, rendering, and animation with
the U3D system. It is a robust loader, effectively, to double-check that a specific
model can be correctly loaded and rendered through the glTFBuilder.

If a model doesn't seem to load correctly first try importing it into Blender
and re-exporting it as a GLB or GLTF as the system has been designed around
Blender's export formatting. If that still doesn't work and you believe your 
model isn't using any unsupported features then please file a bug report!

### Loading Models
Any GLTF of GLB files located in the `test-models` folder should be automatically
detected by the system and a button spawned in the interface.
