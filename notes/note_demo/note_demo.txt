# About

The demo scene is a setup to test loading models, rendering, and animation with
the U3D system. It is a robust loader, effectively, to double-check that a specific
model can be correctly loaded and rendered through the glTFBuilder.

If a model doesn't seem to load correctly first try importing it into Blender
and re-exporting it as a GLB or GLTF as the system has been designed around
Blender's export formatting. If that still doesn't work and you believe your 
model isn't using any unsupported features then please file a bug report!

### Loading Models
Any GLTF of GLB files located in the `test-models` folder should be automatically
detected by the system and a button spawned in the interface.

### Excuses
So yeah, I whipped up the demo loader for myself to do a quick test. I kept it
sloppy. I slowly kept adding things as I needed to test more things so the 
system is a bit of a mess. 

Since I am including it, I went through a lot of stuff and cleaned it up and
added some comments but I didn't bother re-designing things to work better. As
such, don't use this as an example as to how the 3D systems should be set up, 
at least not as a whole. A lot of this stuff is overly convoluted as I changed
things a lot as I went.

By the time this is public I'll have a video demonstrating basic system
setups. I'm assuming it will be available either on my Patreon or Odysee account:
