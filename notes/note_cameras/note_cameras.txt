# Cameras

## About

Cameras are how you view the 3D world in your game. A camera should be created
and then added to `obj_render_controller` in order for it to start rendering.

Cameras inherit from the `Node()` class and, as such, can have their positions and
orientations changed just as you would a Node. Cameras look down the +X axis and
consider Y+ their 'UP' vector by default.

There are various kinds of cameras and the base `Camera()` class can be inherited
to create new kinds as necessary. This provides you the ability to have cameras that
render to the screen, to VR headset, or just an in-game surface for effects like
portals or dynamic cube-map generation.
